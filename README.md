## Project description

**Solar Eclipse Viz** is a webpage focused on the vizualisation of data about each solar eclipse between 1970 and 2070, so 50 years before today ans 50 years after today. This is interesting because each of theses eclipses cans have been seen or will be seen by the user. 

## Main features

Thanks to our project, the user will be able to :
* Choose any solar eclipse between 1970 and 2070, see its parameters (type, duration, size, ...) and know where it was (or will be) possible to better watch this solar eclipse.
* Understand the periodic phenomenon of *Saros*.
* For each solar eclipse in the past, find where and when a similar solar eclipse will take place. Inversely, for each solar eclipse in the future, find where and when a similar solar eclipses has already taken place.
* Select a geographic place on earth and find the eclipses taking place there, for a given time interval.
* Compare statistics between different time intervals.
* And many other features, your only limit is your imagination !

## Credits

The data used for this vizualisation is given by the NASA (Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak, NASA's GSFC, see https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEdecade/SEdecade1971.html) and is available in a friendly shape at Kaggle (see https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/solar-eclipses?fbclid=IwAR2UCw9-HOuhfdZv6Am8VPbllwrt_1D4H6i75bI-wLz42LPEG_lqIOzXzpI#solar.csv). The part of the data we used is available at https://github.com/Daniel-Dht/solarEclipse-viz/blob/master/solar_1950_2050.csv for eclipse parameters and at https://github.com/Daniel-Dht/solarEclipse-viz/blob/master/all_paths.json for eclipse shadow paths.
